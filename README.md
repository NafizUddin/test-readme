This is the 7th assignment of Complete Web Development Course of Programming Hero. Here I have given the answers of the questions.

## [Some Project Features](https://github.com/programming-hero-web-course2/my-course-roster-NafizUddin)

There are some features in this project. Here I have provided some of them:

- Add to Cart - There is a button in the courses' body named "select" by which we can add that course to the cart section. In the cart section, the selected course are shown as a list.

- Calculate credit - As a default, total 20 credits are given to a user for purchasing the courses and each course has a credit. After selecting a course, the amount of each course credit are deducted from the total credit. The credits which are consumed by a user are also calculated in cart section.

- Calculate total price - Each course has a price. The courses which are selected by a user have a total amount and that amount is calculated and shown in the cart section.

- Remove from Cart - There is a button beside each selected course and a user can remove that selected course by this feature.

## [Management of states in the project](https://github.com/programming-hero-web-course2/my-course-roster-NafizUddin)

First of all, I have created a state for storing the all courses' cards. Then by using useEffect hook, I have loaded the data from API and set the data to state.
